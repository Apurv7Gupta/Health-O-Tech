# Health-O-Tech
A Front-End design project made for the Health Informatics Club

# Overview
* The static website is made entirely using HTML and CSS, based on themes that collaborate Healthcare technology and Computer Science, it currently serves as a template to the official website of the Health-O-Tech 
  club.

# Details about the website
* The website's design is clean and professional, while the content is arranged for easier navigation and readability.
* For getting the user up-to-date with everything we do and have done, the site offers several tabs, which are based on every kind of activity that goes on inside the club, from hackathons to recorded guest 
  lectures, so that nothing is missed.
* In the "Project Showcases" tab, I have included the *Immunization Prediction Model* that was given to us during the task round, so that the users can get to see a glimpse of what we actually do and what our 
  projects comprise of; the users can read about the project, download the dataset and the model code, so that they can test the model locally if they want to.
* If a user wishes to join the club, they can just visit the website and fill out the "Join Us" form present in the home tab, which is the first thing someone sees when they open the site. 
* The siteâ€™s use of stacked tabs on smaller screens and thoughtfully organized sections ensures a smooth user experience across devices, catering to both desktop and mobile users.
* The site also offers a "Contact Us" form at the end, which asks the users their name, email and the message they want to convey, which allows them to suggest improvements or criticisms about the website.

# Mobile Device Functionalities
* In order to make the website compatible with devices that have smaller screens (eg: A mobile phone), the tabs have been made to stack over each other, so that it's easier to navigate, instead of scrolling across the screen.
* Another thing thats changed is the removal of the background gallery, change of color of the cards and the "Join Us" form on the home tab, which have been made white instead of transparent, so that the content 
  appears clearer on smaller devices.
