# Health-O-Tech
A Front-End design project made for the Health Informatics Club

# Overview
* The static website is made entirely using HTML and CSS, based on themes that collaborate Healthcare technology and Computer Science, it currently serves as a template to the official website of the Health-O-Tech 
  club.

# Details about the website
* The website's design is clean and professional, with content organized for easy navigation and readability.
* To geta user up-to-date on club activities, the site offers multiple tabs highlighting different activities, including hackathons, guest lectures, and more.
* In the "Project Showcases" tab, I have included the *Immunization Prediction Model* that was given to us during the task round, so that the users can get to see a glimpse of what we actually do and what our 
  projects comprise of; the users can read about the project, download the datasetand and access the model code to test it locally.
* For new members, a "Join Us" form is available on the home tab, easily accessible as the first thing users see upon visiting.. 
* The siteâ€™s use of stacked tabs on smaller screens and thoughtfully organized sections ensures a smooth user experience across devices, catering to both desktop and mobile users.
* A "Contact Us" form at the end of the site allows users to provide feedback, offering their name, email, and message for suggestions or improvements.
# Mobile Device Functionalities
* In order to make the website compatible with devices that have smaller screens (eg: A mobile phone), the tabs have been made to stack over each other, so that it's easier to navigate, instead of scrolling across the screen.
* Another thing thats changed is the removal of the background gallery, change of color of the cards and the "Join Us" form on the home tab, which have been made white instead of transparent, so that the content 
  appears clearer on smaller devices.
