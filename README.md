# Health-O-Tech
A Front-End design project made for the Health Informatics Club

# Overview
* The static website is made entirely using HTML and CSS, based on themes that collaborate Healthcare technology and Computer Science, it currently serves as a template to the official website of the Health-O-Tech 
  club.

# Details about the website
* The website's design is clean and professional, with content organized for easy navigation and readability.
* To get a user up-to-date on club activities, the site offers multiple tabs highlighting different activities, including hackathons, guest lectures, and more.
* In the "Project Showcases" tab, I have included the *Immunization Prediction Model* that was given to us during the task round, so that the users can get to see a glimpse of what we actually do and what our 
  projects comprise of; the users can read about the project, download the dataset and access the model code to test it locally.
* For new members, a "Join Us" form is available on the home tab, easily accessible as it is the first thing users see upon visiting.. 
* A "Contact Us" form at the end of the site allows users to provide feedback, offering their name, email, and message for suggestions or improvements.
# Mobile Device Functionalities
* On smaller screens (e.g., mobile phones), tabs stack vertically to improve navigation without the need for horizontal scrolling.
* For enhanced readability, the background gallery is removed, the colour of the cards and the "Join Us" form are changed to a solid white background, making content clearer on mobile devices.
